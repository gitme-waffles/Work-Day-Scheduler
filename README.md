## Work Day Schedueler

```
This application is a simple day schedule that shows the user the current day.
Each timeblock is colour coded to show the time in a given work day. 
* Grey for timed passed
* Red for current time
* Green for the rest of the day to come

The user can input text in the text field that saves to local storage that can be rendered even after refresh or if the browser has been closed
```
